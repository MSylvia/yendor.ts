# Gizmo - a lightweight immediate widget toolkit
This directory contains the source code of Gizmo, a lightweight immediate widget toolkit.

To understand the concept of immediate widgets, see http://www.johno.se/book/imgui.html.

Right now, the toolkit is pretty empty as it contains only what is needed by GeneRogue. More widgets will be supported as the game UI gets more complex.

# TODO

Reminder for stuff that might be added to the toolkit. Or not.

* Core
    - modal widgets should reset Umbra input automagically
    - handle generic key bindings (Gizmo.Configuration.input)
* Widgets
    - textBox
