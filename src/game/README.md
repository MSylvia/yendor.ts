This directory contains the source code of GeneRogue, a generic roguelike loosely based on the famous [python roguelike tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod).

The name `GeneRogue` is a reference to Kornel Kisielewicz's mammoth [GenRogue project](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=GenRogue). Even if it was never released, it has been a major source of inspiration.

To compile it, run `jake` then open game/index.html in your browser.
